Portfolio Project: Advanced Inventory Management System (MyStock)

Welcome to my portfolio showcasing a robust inventory management system that I have developed. This project is centered around efficient stock control, incorporating an array of features such as categorization, product management, supplier tracking, and transaction recording.

Key Features:

Categories and Products: The system employs a meticulous categorization mechanism, allowing for seamless organization and retrieval of products. Each product is intricately defined within its respective category, facilitating efficient data management.

Suppliers Management: An integrated supplier management system ensures a comprehensive view of all partners involved. This feature not only maintains a list of suppliers but also establishes robust relationships with the products they provide.

Entries and Exits Tracking: The heart of the system lies in its ability to track the flow of inventory. Whether it's product entries, indicating the addition of new stock, or exits, signifying sales or removals, every transaction is meticulously recorded, providing a transparent and traceable history of the inventory.

CRUD Operations: I have implemented a sophisticated CRUD system, going beyond the basics. Each operation (Create, Read, Update, Delete) has been fine-tuned to ensure data integrity and consistency. This involves intricate relationships between database tables, guaranteeing a seamless user experience.

Exception Handling: Recognizing the complexity of real-world scenarios, I have incorporated robust exception handling within the application. This ensures that the system can gracefully manage unforeseen circumstances, providing a resilient and reliable user experience.

User Flow Optimization: The user interface has been designed with a focus on simplicity and intuitiveness. Navigating through the system is seamless, with logical workflows that enhance user productivity. From product management to transaction tracking, the user is guided through each process with clarity.

Technologies Used:

# Frontend: Razor Pages, HTML, CSS.
# Backend: C#, .NET.
# Database: Entity Framework, SQL Sever
Future Enhancements: Front End improvement.

This project is not just a static representation but a living, evolving system, ensuring the continual improvement and adaptability of the inventory management system.

Thank you for exploring my portfolio project. I am proud to present a comprehensive inventory management solution that not only meets the basic requirements but goes above and beyond in addressing the intricacies of inventory control. Feel free to explore the code and documentation for a deeper understanding of the system's architecture and functionality.
